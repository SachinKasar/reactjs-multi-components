# Reactjs multiple components

1. Thinking in ReactJS-Components.
2. Component composition

4. Container component - index.js
5. Functional Component -
      - FourWheeler is Functionals component
      - Similar to ForurWheeler, other all components can be converted to functional component.

Benefits of Functional components :
   - Focused on presentations and not on behaviour.
   - Easily testable without mocking required.
   - Performance improvement, as there are no lifecycle hooks 
     and state manupilation, React planning to skips many 
     checks and memory alocation for such components
